## Installation ##
Create a PodFile with :

    use_frameworks!

	target 'C8oSDKiOS' do
	  pod 'C8oSDK', '2.0.4'
	end

run `pod install`

Restart Xcode and open the .xcworkspace

And there you go !

## Sample code ##

Initializing a Convertigo Enpoint:

	import C8o

	// In swift there is two ways to handle errors :
	// We can either choose to don't care about errors using the following syntax (this may produce in case of error an "EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION")

	let c8o : C8o = try! C8o(endpoint: "https://demo.convertigo.net/cems/projects/sampleMobileCtfGallery", c8oSettings: nil)
	
	// or we can choose to use do/catch syntax that will allow us to catch errors
	do{
		let c8o : C8o = try C8o(endpoint: "https://demo.convertigo.net/cems/projects/sampleMobileCtfGallery", c8oSettings: nil)
	}
	catch let e as NSError{
		print(e.description)
	}
	// the C8o instance is ready to interact over https with the demo.convertigo.net server, using sampleMobileUsDirectoryDemo as default project.


Calling a Convertigo Requestable:

	import SwiftyJSON

	// c8o is a C8o instance
	let JObject : JSON = try! c8o.callJson(".getSimpleData")!.sync()!

	// You now have JSON objecct that you can use in your app!
